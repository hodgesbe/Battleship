# Battleship

## Overview
This is my version of the battleship boardgame. It will hopefully evolve into a game that can either be played with two or more people or AIs.
This game will not be true to the classic game but is inspired by it. The game board will be larger and more complex; there will be multiple
military craft with different capabilities. This will still be a turn based strategy game, however it hopes to incorporate deeper military
strategy.
